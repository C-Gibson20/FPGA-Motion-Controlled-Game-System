# Motion-Controlled Multiplayer Gaming System

<br>

## Overview
This project demonstrates a full-stack, low-latency motion-controlled multiplayer gaming platform integrating embedded FPGA signal processing, real-time cloud networking, and 3D web rendering. The system was designed and coursework for Year 2 **Information Processing** module, part of the **Electronic and Information Engineering** curriculum at **Imperial College London**.

## Hardware Layer â€“ Embedded Signal Processing on FPGA

**Platform:** Intel DE10-Lite FPGA
**Languages/Tools:** Verilog, Quartus Prime, Nios II, System Console

* **Sensor Interface**: A 3-axis accelerometer communicates with the FPGA via SPI.
* **FIR Filtering**: A **custom hardware FIR filter** in Verilog smooths raw accelerometer data to mitigate jitter and sensor noise, with real-time tuning visualised via onboard LEDs.
* **Thresholding Logic**: A **Nios II soft-core processor** processes filtered motion signals using a calibrated threshold model, ensuring only meaningful player movements trigger gameplay events.
* **Communication**: Triggered motion events are serialized and transmitted over **UART** to a local client system, ensuring efficient bandwidth use and minimal latency.

### Hardware Latency Optimization

| Filtering Method    | Mean Latency |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| No Filter           | 19.15 Âµs     |
| Software Filter     | 3.556 ms     |
| **Hardware Filter** | **31.02 Âµs** |

<br>

## Client Layer â€“ Local Node Gateway

* **Language/Tech**: Python (lightweight script)
* Receives UART packets from the FPGA.
* Immediately forwards raw motion events to the AWS-hosted backend via a **TCP socket**.
* The design avoids any computational overhead or buffering, enabling a fast, pass-through model.

## Server Layer â€“ AWS Modular Backend

**Deployment:** AWS EC2 instance
**Languages/Frameworks:** Python, Flask, WebSocket, Threading

* **WebSocket Server**: Maintains persistent bi-directional connections with all frontend clients for real-time updates.
* **FPGA Event Handler**: Parses, validates, and timestamps incoming motion events.
* **Game Manager**: Coordinates shared game state, manages mini-game delegation, and ensures synchronisation across players.
* **Mini-Game Modules**: Encapsulate core gameplay logic, state machines, animations, and scoring mechanisms.
* **Score Service**: Flask-based microservice using a database to persist global scores and player history.

## Frontend Layer â€“ Web-Based 3D Game Renderer

**Frameworks:** React.js, Three.js, WebSocket API

* **Visualisation**: Game elements and player avatars are rendered in real-time using Three.js, enabling dynamic 3D animation and effects.
* **Event Handling**: Motion-triggered events are translated into player actions (e.g., jumps, dashes) based on server instructions.
* **Multiplayer Support**: Each client syncs animations and game progress using the serverâ€™s authoritative game state, ensuring consistent visuals across all connected nodes.
* **User Experience Enhancements**: Includes background music, interactive sound effects, and animated transitions triggered by player motion.

## Latency and Performance Measurement

A custom latency measurement pipeline was implemented across four stages:

1. **Hardware Filtering Latency** â€“ FPGA internal processing
2. **FPGA â†’ Client Transmission** â€“ UART timing
3. **Client â†’ Frontend Reception** â€“ TCP/WebSocket timing
4. **Frontend â†’ Render Execution** â€“ animation trigger delay

| Stage                        | Mean Latency |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| FPGA â†’ Frontend Receive      | \~133 ms     |
| Frontend Receive â†’ Render    | \~10 ms      |
| Frontend â†’ Game Logic Update | \~43 ms      |

* **Clock Synchronisation**: FPGA timestamps are calibrated against browser-based `performance.now()` to account for drift and ensure cross-platform temporal accuracy.

<br>

## System Testing and Validation

* **Phased Testing Approach**:

  * Keyboard-based prototypes for game mechanics
  * UART motion testing with FPGA output triggers
  * Multiplayer testbeds with multiple DE10-Lite boards
  * End-to-end latency logging and debugging using `requestAnimationFrame()`
* **Hardware Debugging**:

  * Hex LED indicators for player identity
  * Buttons for triggering test animations
  * Real-time LED feedback for FIR filter tuning
